            We made this website to give soccer (or f√∫tbol) fans everywhere to
            put their favorite players and teams head to head. Growing up, we
            supported rival teams so this project gave us a great way to find
            out who's club is really the best. We hope you enjoy this app as
            much as we did making it!
